3# Introduction

Ponzu is a fork of the Goldman Sachs gs-collections framework.  The main difference is that the primary iteration protocol methods have been renamed:

| **gs-collections** |  **ponzu**     |

| select         | filter     |
| reject         | filterNot  |
| detect         | find       |
| collect        | transform  |
| injectInto     | foldLeft   |
