Introduction
------------

Ponzu is a fork of the Goldman Sachs gs-collections framework.  The main difference is that the primary iteration protocol methods have been renamed:

gs-collections |  ponzu
select        ->  filter
reject        ->  filterNot
detect        ->  find
collect       ->  transform
injectInto    ->  foldLeft
